<article>
<p>I have decided to write code that will tell about the camping/hiking trip I went on with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>The story tells about us getting prepared to go.  We had to keep an eye on the dog who was not on a leash.  I also wrote about once the snow got to a certain depth, we had to turn around.</p>
